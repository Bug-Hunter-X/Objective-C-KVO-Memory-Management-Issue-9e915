In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not properly removed when it's no longer needed, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This often happens when the observed object is deallocated, but the observer still holds a strong reference to it, preventing its deallocation.  For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... handle changes ...
}
@end

// In another class:
MyObject *myObj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myObj addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myString" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
// ... later, myObj may get deallocated ...
// ... but the observer still exists, creating a dangling pointer.
```
This can be solved by removing the observer explicitly in `-dealloc` or when it's no longer needed, using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:`.
